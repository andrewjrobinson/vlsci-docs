<h2 id="what-is-genomespace">What is GenomeSpace?</h2>
<p>GenomeSpace is a cloud-based interoperability framework to support integrative genomics analysis through an easy-to-use Web interface. GenomeSpace provides access to a diverse range of bioinformatics tools, and bridges the gaps between the tools, making it easy to leverage the available analyses and visualizations in each of them. The tools retain their native look and feel, with GenomeSpace providing frictionless conduits between them through a lightweight interoperability layer.</p>
<p>GenomeSpace does not perform any analyses itself; these are done within the member tools wherever they live – desktop, Web service, cloud, in-house server, etc. Rather, GenomeSpace provides tool selection and launch capabilities, and acts as a data highway automatically reformatting data as required when results move from the output of one tool to input for the next.</p>
<p>The GVL GenomeSpace can be found at <a href="https://genomespace.genome.edu.au">https://genomespace.genome.edu.au</a>.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>GenomeSpace uses a few dialogue boxes to communicate with the NeCTAR cloud. If you have an AdBlocker installed, the dialogues will not be shown properly. If you have an AdBlocker on your system please disable it for the GenomeSpace.genome.edu.au domain.</p>

<h2 id="mounting-a-swift-container">Mounting a swift container</h2>
<p><em>(These instructions are for the NeCTAR Australian Research Cloud. For any other OpenStack-based cloud storage please change the parameters as necessary.)</em></p>
<p>NeCTAR object storage is a place that people with NeCTAR credentials can store their data reliably. Containers can be found under the Object Store link in NeCTAR’s dashboard.</p>
<p>To browse through available containers, go to the NeCTAR dashboard at <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au">https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au</a> . On the left hand side of the dashboard you can find the Object Store. By "Containers" you can see all the available containers within your tenancy.</p>
<p>To mount an available container go to Connect menu bar in GenomeSpace and select Swift Container.
