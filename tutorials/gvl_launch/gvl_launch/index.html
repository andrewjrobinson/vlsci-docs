<hr />
<h2 id="tutorial-overview">Tutorial Overview</h2>
<p>This document guides you to launch your own GVL Analysis platform, with Galaxy,
using your default NeCTAR allocation.</p>
<p>The tutorial will go over:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accessing the NeCTAR dashboard using Australian Access Federation (AAF)
   credentials</li>
<li>Getting your NeCTAR Research Cloud credentials</li>
<li>Launching the GVL image</li>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<h4 id="what-is-the-gvl">What is the GVL?</h4>
<p>The Genomics Virtual Laboratory (GVL) is a research platform that can be
deployed on the cloud.</p>
<p><img src="../media/gvl_dashboard.png" height=500px style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto;"></p>
<p>A private GVL server is a virtual machine running on the cloud and contains a
pre-installed suite of tools for performing bioinformatics analyses. It differs
from public GVL servers (such as the
<a href="http://galaxy-tut.genome.edu.au/">Galaxy Tutorial Server</a>,
<a href="http://galaxy-mel.genome.edu.au/">Galaxy Melbourne</a>, and
<a href="http://galaxy-qld.genome.edu.au/">Galaxy Queensland</a>) by providing full
administrative access to the server, as well as the full suite of GVL services,
whereas public GVL servers provide restricted access for security reasons.
For example, public GVL servers do not provide access to the Ubuntu desktop,
the Linux command line or JupyterHub at present.</p>
<p>Accessing the GVL server is completely free on the Australian NeCTAR Research
Cloud, provided that you have a account with NeCTAR with allocated resources.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-nectar">What is NeCTAR?</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://nectar.org.au/">National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources project</a>
(NeCTAR) is an Australian programme that provides computing infrastructure
and services to Australian researchers. The NeCTAR Cloud allows us to
deploy virtual machines as a platform for research.</p>
<p>While it is possible to launch the GVL on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>,
you may have to pay Amazon usage charges (the GVL software itself is free).</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="section-1-access-the-nectar-dashboard">Section 1: Access the NeCTAR dashboard</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Login into the NeCTAR dashboard at
    <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au">dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au</a>.<br />
    Only members of the Australian Access Federation (AAF) can access Australian
    Research Cloud resources. Most Australian universities are members of the
    AAF, however, if you belong to an institution that is not a member of AAF,
    <a href="http://genome.edu.au/help/gvl-help">GVL Help</a> may be able to provide you
    with credentials. You also have the option of using a commercial cloud
    provider such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> to host your server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose your organisation from the list and login using your credentials.
    If you are from the University of Melbourne, choose 'The University of
    Melbourne' and not 'The University of Melbourne (with ECP)'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Login with your institutional username and password. If this is the first
    time you have accessed the Australian Research Cloud, you must agree to some
    terms and conditions.</p>
<p>When you log in for the first time, you are automatically allocated a trial
project which lasts for 3 months. This trial project allows you to launch a
medium instance (with 2 cores) which is sufficient for launching a GVL
instance.</p>
<p><img src="../media/nectar_dashboard.png" height=400px style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto;"></p>
<p>If you have projects which require more compute resources, you can apply
for more allocation <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/allocation/">here</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="section-2-get-your-cloud-credentials">Section 2: Get your cloud credentials</h2>
<p>Launching a GVL instance requires EC2 API keys from NeCTAR. Obtaining these keys
is a simple 3 step process.</p>
<p><img src="../media/get_ec2_annotated.png" height=400px/></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From the NeCTAR dashboard, on the left sidebar, navigate to<br />
    Project &gt; Compute &gt; Access &amp; Security</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the top <strong>'API Access'</strong> tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the <strong>'+ View Credentials'</strong> button on the top right. A window
    containing your API access key (1) and your secret key (2) will appear.
    Click on the eye icon to view your secret key. Keep this key secret and
    secure.</p>
<p><img src="../media/ec2_creds_annotated.png" height=300px/></p>
<p>Keep this page open for later reference.</p>
</li>
</ol>

    this tutorial, it is not necessary to modify any of the advanced options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Placement:</strong> You can also choose the region of where your server is
  hosted. If you are doing lots of data transfer, it may be beneficial to
  pick a location close to your physical location. More information about
  zones can be found <a href="https://support.rc.nectar.org.au/docs/availability-zones">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Key pair:</strong> Key pairs are SSH credentials that can be used to access
  your instance. You can create and import key pairs in the NeCTAR dashboard
  by navigating to Project &gt; Compute &gt; Access &amp; Security &gt; Key Pairs and
  creating or importing a key pair.</li>
<li><strong>Image:</strong> The image to start. The default option is usually the latest,
  most stable GVL image.</li>
<li><strong>Flavor:</strong> Flavours are versions of the GVL with slightly customised
  toolsets. These toolsets are optimised for different usage patterns. More
  information about the different flavours can be found
  <a href="http://genome.edu.au/get/get#gvlflavours">here</a>. For this tutorial, keep
  the default option of 'GVL + Tutorial Indices'</li>
</ul>
